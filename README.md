# Akka HTTP microservice Authenthication example


This project is to show how easy is to develop a simple microservice, in this case an authenthication one:

* starting standalone HTTP server (Main),
* handling file-based configuration (Config, application.conf),
* routing (see routes package),
* deconstructing requests,
* querying database through services,
* easy way to use Cassandra or whatever Db you please,
* nice way to structure your microservice


## Testing

This is missing but coming soon.

## Author & license

This project is totally open source, if there is any question then do it via github, thanks.
